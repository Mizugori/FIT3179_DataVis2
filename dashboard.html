      <p>
        The Australian bushfires of 2019 were some of the most devastating in the history of 
        the country, causing widespread destruction all across the country and leaving 
        millions of people in the southern hemisphere swamped in smoke.
        One of the defining characteristics of the fires was the long timeframe that they
        burned for.

          In a typical year, the fire season in Australia begins around October in most 
          states, with some small fires occurring as early as July. However in 2019, 
          widespread burning occurred throughout parts of Queensland and New South Wales, 
          during the month of September, with numerous fires in other parts of the country. 
          The map to the left shows the locations of probable fires in during the months of 
          August and September in 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the map, the brightness corresponds roughly to how hot the fire is, offset by 
          how emissive the surface of the Earth is at the location the fire
          is burning at. More information can be found 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brightness_temperature">here</a>.

        <p>
          Over this timeframe, there was a significant number of fires that burned, 
          peaking at just under 1,400 fires a day. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As it got later in the year, the number of fires generally increased, as would 
          generally be expected as conditions became generally hotter and drier.  
        </p>
        <div class="space_filler"></div>
        <p>
          More concerningly, the amount of thermal radiation (and therefore the ability of 
          the fire to spread near its current location) increased consistently as the 
          season progressed towards the end of September. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The plot immediately to the right shows this trend over the period, with the 
          median radiative power shown for each day, with the range of values that the
          middle 50% of the fires on the day also highlighted.

          However, the amount of thermal radiation increases very quickly compared to the 
          tempearture, as is illustrated in the plot to the left. This means that the 
          of the fire to spread increases drastically compared to how hot the fire is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifically, we know from basic physics that the radiative power of the fire is 
          proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (more information 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#Radiative_power">here</a>
          ), which matches up with the general shape of the plot to the left, particularly 
          the bounding lines of the data.
          As a note, the variation of the data from any one particular curve can be
          explained by the varying amount of emissivity of the Earth over various locations 
          - more information is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissivity">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For reference, a fire that outputs 1000 MW of radiative power will emmit in one
          hour over 140 times the amount of energy the average Australian home uses 
          in one year.

          The map to the right shows how the fires evolved in different locations over the 
          course of these two months. Use the bottom graph to select a period of time and 
          then move it around to see how the fires changed over time.
